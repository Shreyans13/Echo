# Echo - The Amazon Clone 

## Getting Started
The "Svelte Amazon Clone" repository is for learning Svelte, a modern JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. By creating an Amazon clone, this project provided me a hands-on learning experience that combines the power of Svelte with the familiarity of a widely recognized e-commerce platform.
Hosted at Github Pages [here](https://echo-5whz65c5a-shreyans13.vercel.app/).
